# CryptoPrice
A simple script that fetches the price of specified cryptocurrencies on system startup

This script is hardcoded to return the price of Ethereum, Solana and Polkadot, but it can be modified to return any cyptocurrency.

Put the script in your OS's Startup folder and it will run every time you boot up.

For Windows:

C:\Users\[USER_NAME]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
